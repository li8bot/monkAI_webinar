Images are highly chaotic sources of signals which a minor change in perspective causing major changes in data. Plagued with noise during capture, human visual processing is still a mystery and yet too basic for us. 

Several key decision making processes today require Visual Intelligence. The innate ability to percieve, process and decide based on visual inputs is one of the key definitions of intelligence. Mimicking this intelligence into silicon based machines has been a task pursued by researchers since decades.

Deep Learning applications has seen a tremedous rise in its applications to Computer Vision. As a precursor to Deep Learning, having a fundamental understanding of Image Processing will help you gain necessary skills to build the right solutions.

In this webinar we will go over how the fundamentals of Digital Image Processing, take a look at how Image data is stored and processed within computational systems and briefly look at Color representations in digital images.

Featuring speakers of this meetup are Abhishek Kumar and Akash Deep Singh from Tessellate Imaging, India. [Tessellate Imaging](https://tessellateimaging.com) helps businesses across the globe set up their Computer Vision and Deep Learning infrastructure.

## About the authors

### Abhishek Kumar Annamraju -- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhishek-kumar-annamraju/)
Abhishek’s research areas include computer vision, machine learning, natural language processing, and photogrammetry.
As a part of his undergraduate thesis and then continued employment at Tata Elxsi R&D, India, he worked on on-road real-time vehicle detection. He has published research papers on cascade classifiers, shape-based object analysis, and traffic sign classifier (IET Intelligent Transport Systems journal). His past projects include image-based monitoring solutions to curb illegal sand mining, 3D facial model generation and classification, deep learning based face recognition, and camera auto-calibration for fisheye images (Tesseract Imaging, India). He was also a part of the Mahindra Rise Challenge 2014 and developed real-time stationary-cam object detection modules.
He participated in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2016, working with Open-Detection, to develop GUI-based deep learning training and classification system. His research work includes projects involving forensic sketch to image matching and biomedical image processing.
Abhishek got his B.E (Hons.) degree in Electrical and Electronics from BITS Pilani, K.K. Birla Goa Campus.

### Akash Deep Singh -- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akashdeepsingh01/)
Akash is a tech wiz, passionate about solving real-world problems with artificial intelligence and machine vision.
He’s worked on building novel systems to detect & classify glioma cancer and a camera-based real-time stat generation solution for basketball players. He was also part of the team which built India’s first panoramic camera where he acted as the Machine Learning Lead. His past projects include autopilot firmware for search and rescue drones, building disguised and imposter face recognition software, an all-terrain navigation vehicle, and sketch to face image matching for forensics.
A national cyber Olympiad gold medalist, he loves reading books.
Akash earned his B.E. (Hons.) degree in Electronics and Instrumentation from BITS Pilani, K.K. Birla Goa Campus.
