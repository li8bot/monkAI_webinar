#### What you’ll learn
 - Build an Image Classification application
 - Use Transfer Learning with MonkAI
 - Understand Deep Learning development workflow

#### Pre-requisites
- Basic Python programming
- Exposure to Deep Learning terminologies

In the recent pandemic breakout of the COVID-19 virus, cases of respiratory lung diseases have seen an immense increase. With researchers, doctors, and caretakers working 24x7 across the world, we realize the call to the technology world to make the process of identifying and catering to affected patients more efficient and effective.

Deep learning methods have been shown to outperform human visual intelligence in several areas of medical image analysis. Applications of Computer Vision in analyzing Histopathology slides, CT scans, MRIs and X-Rays is expediting the process of initial disease discovery inside pathologies.

In this webinar, we will learn to build an image classification system that takes as input a Chest X-Ray image and predicts the chances of the patient having Pneumonia.
Along the way, we shall understand the basics of Transfer Learning based Image Classification and learn about Deep Learning workflows using our open-source toolkit MonkAI.

## About the authors

### Abhishek Kumar Annamraju -- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhishek-kumar-annamraju/)
Abhishek’s research areas include computer vision, machine learning, natural language processing, and photogrammetry.
As a part of his undergraduate thesis and then continued employment at Tata Elxsi R&D, India, he worked on on-road real-time vehicle detection. He has published research papers on cascade classifiers, shape-based object analysis, and traffic sign classifier (IET Intelligent Transport Systems journal). His past projects include image-based monitoring solutions to curb illegal sand mining, 3D facial model generation and classification, deep learning based face recognition, and camera auto-calibration for fisheye images (Tesseract Imaging, India). He was also a part of the Mahindra Rise Challenge 2014 and developed real-time stationary-cam object detection modules.
He participated in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2016, working with Open-Detection, to develop GUI-based deep learning training and classification system. His research work includes projects involving forensic sketch to image matching and biomedical image processing.
Abhishek got his B.E (Hons.) degree in Electrical and Electronics from BITS Pilani, K.K. Birla Goa Campus.

### Akash Deep Singh -- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akashdeepsingh01/)
Akash is a tech wiz, passionate about solving real-world problems with artificial intelligence and machine vision.
He’s worked on building novel systems to detect & classify glioma cancer and a camera-based real-time stat generation solution for basketball players. He was also part of the team which built India’s first panoramic camera where he acted as the Machine Learning Lead. His past projects include autopilot firmware for search and rescue drones, building disguised and imposter face recognition software, an all-terrain navigation vehicle, and sketch to face image matching for forensics.
A national cyber Olympiad gold medalist, he loves reading books.
Akash earned his B.E. (Hons.) degree in Electronics and Instrumentation from BITS Pilani, K.K. Birla Goa Campus.
